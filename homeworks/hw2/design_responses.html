						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about how white space is important and is a powerful tool when used wisely. Too little whitespace makes your user feel chaotic and difficult to navigate through mess of everything. Putting enough whitespace makes your audience focus on a certain aspect of your website that you want them to look at more closely. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when they showed the pictures side by side. Seeing a juxtaposition of before and after adding whitespace helped understand what the author was talking about. It was fun to learn that sometimes less is more even in designing websites. </p>
