							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It's important to incorporate human psychology in designing your UI. You have to make sure that all your design elements are consistent and follow the same rules. They also have to naturally make sense. User interface design is about communication and convenience.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It was interesting to learn about all the stuff that we knew intuitively and name all of the design principles explicitly. The pictures were good examples in showing how the design principles were applied practically. It was nice that they did for all the principles individually.</p>
