                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that small changes in transitory animations can make a big difference for the user. Something so minor like animation can make your app or website look very much alive and interactive. I think this sort of thing really grabs the user's attention and encourages them to stay. However, I did notice that some animations personally for me felt a bit over the top. It's always about balance in the end. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Just being able to look through each animation was really cool. Comparing them side by side made it easy to see the strenghts and weakenesses of each design choice. I think seeing a bunch of variety of designs was really helpful for me to come with my own ideas.</p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think my favorite one was the cryptocurrency transaction. Something so boring such as a transaction became so fun to observe. It also for me looked the most complex and difficult to implement. I thought it was amazing how they could come up with something so vibrant. </p>
