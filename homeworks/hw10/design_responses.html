							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like that the article described attention as a limited resource for digital products. I thought the cocktail party effect was an interesting phenomenon that could easily be incorporated into design. I also liked the part they give all the various types of attentions into categories. I will definitely be more aware of where to put certain things by paying attention to human psychology.</p>
