					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It's important to use colors that allows even colorbind people to see clearly. Contrast ratio is can determine how accessible a certain color is. Color doesn't have to always be the detail that gives information. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought it was interesting how they said of lack of accessbility is "rude". The colorblind friendly mode was helpful in showing how to increase accessibility. It was also interesting to see how there are official guidelines like WCAG 2.1 for accessibility.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
